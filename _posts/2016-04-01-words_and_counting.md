# Words and numbers

Write a function:

    * that can find all the numbers in a sentence;
    * that find all words shorter than 3 in a sentence;
    * that count all the words in a sentence;
    * that count all numbers in a sentence.

Use this sentence to test:    

`I saw 3 bears, and 7 toads in 50 meters from tallest tree`

But use other sentences to test it as well.
