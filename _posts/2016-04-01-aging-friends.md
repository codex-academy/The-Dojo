# Aging friends

Write a function to tell me which of my friends is the oldest.

`Xola is 23, Peter is 18, Oya is 29, Ellie is 20, Sive is 27`

By the way, which of my friends are younger than Ellie?

Other friends said they will send you their list of friends as well... so make sure you function will work for that too. Like this:

`Theo is 42, Nhlanhla is 36, Hugh is 77`
